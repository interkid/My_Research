Working with PyTorch tensors . py_list = [1,2,3,4] np_array = np.array([4,7,10,13]) . Q1.1. What is a Tensor? Why can&#39;t we just use numpy arrays or Python lists? . Q1.2. Convert both py_list and np_array to tensors, and name them predictions and labels respectively. . . tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]) . . tensor([ 4, 7, 10, 13]) . Q1.3.

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
